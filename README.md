# Wit By Bit - Assignment
I have used pnpm because it is lightweight and faster
Install pnpm in your root directory by `npm install -g pnpm`
go to the project folder by `cd WitByBit-Assignment` then run `pnpm i` or `pnpm add` and then `pnpm run dev`

Student Space is a Web app to manage Student Marks, results and grades.


## Features

we can add Student from the ADD at the top Right.
Assign the Student Name and class, Score to it, and the Result and Grade are updated Automatically. 

The Student Add form comes with Validation. You can't proceed to confirm unless you have passed write values in input fields.

you can later delete a student with a confirmation message.
